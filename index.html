      <p>Salem was brought to me 3 years ago. I had just moved into my new place and was looking for a companion.
          Not much later during halloween, i found salem in one of my friends apartment complex. I brought her home right away and the rest is history.
         We got along great, she never gave me any problems and was super smart. Everything was perfect. A year later, I had gotten another cat. Learn more about that story below! </p>

         <p>Ollie was the true start of the transition of becoming 'A Cat Daddy'. My friend found him at a gas station and brought him to me knowing I was looking for anoher as a friend to salem.
            2 a.m. and there is a dirty, flea infested kitten. Just sweet as can be and so a bath and some food later and he was just happiest kitten. I learned quickly that every cat is definetly not the same.
            He is now 2 years old and loves going outside to run in the yard before coming inside to nap for the rest of the day. Talk about a life!

         <p>I wasn't planning on getting a third cat but I was brought 3 kittens from a friend who had been looking for a home for them. 
            His mother's cat got pregnant and had them but unfortunately she kept them apart from each other. During the time that I had them, garnet was always so chatty with me, followed me around, and well basically claimed me as her human.
            As much as i picked her, she really picked me and she still talks to me plenty a year later!

         <p class="funParagraph">That's right, a fourth cat! I know what you may be thinking, "thats a lot of cats", well I cant disagree but I dont care. I came home late one night and a 4 week old kitten had be running and screaming towards me.
            Cutest little monster I've ever seen. Not much longer I found her siblings and all of them were adopted! I kept rose and no regrets!
